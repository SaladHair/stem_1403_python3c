Procedural programming and Object-oriented programming

Procedural programming and object-oriented programming are very different from their very cores. First, let's take a
look at procedural programming. Procedural programming is the most typical programming paradigm. The code is organized
and ran from top to bottom, making it easily readable and understandable. However, it is hard to reuse it since every
program is so different from the others. Object-oriented programming, on the other hand, is focused around having
multiple objects interact with each other. These objects contain variables and methods like the programs do in
procedural programming. This type of programming is harder to read and takes more time to write, but it can save a lot
of time thanks to its reusability.
